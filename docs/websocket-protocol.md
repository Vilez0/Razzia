# WebSocket protocol

Razzia's live game communication runs over [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), on the `/ws` path. Everything that is not live game state — identity, quiz storage, results, game creation — is a plain HTTP API under `/api` (see [HTTP API](http-api.md)). This document describes the **player-facing** part of the socket protocol, so you can build an alternative client, for example firmware for an ESP32-based physical buzzer for kids, instead of using the web UI.

A custom client now makes **one HTTP call before connecting**, to obtain a session token.

> This protocol is internal and not version-stabilized. It can change between releases without a deprecation period. Check this file against the version you deploy.

## Connecting

The handshake carries a **signed session token**, not a self-declared id. Get one once and persist it (e.g. in an ESP32's NVS flash):

```
POST /api/auth/session   {}          ->  { token, clientId, role, expiresAt }
POST /api/auth/session   { token }   ->  the same token, while it is still valid
```

Then connect:

```js
io("http://<host>:<port>", {
  path: "/ws",
  auth: { token },
})
```

- The token's `clientId` is the identity the server trusts: it is what lets a player rejoin their seat after a disconnect (Wi-Fi drop, reboot, etc). Reconnecting with the same token triggers the reconnect flow instead of creating a new player. A `clientId` you generate yourself is no longer accepted.
- Player tokens last 30 days. **Re-POST the stored token to `/api/auth/session` before every connection**: an unexpired token comes back unchanged, and an expired one is replaced by a fresh token carrying the same `clientId`, so the seat survives.
- Anyone who knows a 6-character invite code can still join a room, so treat the invite code as a room key.
- The server doesn't override Socket.IO's default keepalive (`pingInterval` 25s / `pingTimeout` 20s). Your client library needs to answer Engine.IO pings within that window or it will be dropped as disconnected.

### Handshake rejections

If the token is missing or unusable the connection is refused with `connect_error`. The error carries `message` (an i18n key) and `data.code`:

| `data.code`     | Meaning                                                | What to do                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `TOKEN_MISSING` | No `auth.token` was sent                               | Call `POST /api/auth/session`, then reconnect   |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Valid signature, past `exp`                            | Re-POST the token to refresh it, then reconnect |
| `TOKEN_INVALID` | Bad signature or malformed (e.g. the server restarted) | Discard it, POST an empty body, then reconnect  |

> **Socket.IO does not retry after these.** The transport itself connected, so the client marks the namespace inactive and stays disconnected until _you_ call `connect()` again. Cap your retries (the web client allows two) so a permanently failing mint cannot spin.

The token is verified **only at the handshake**, never per event, so a token that expires mid-game does not interrupt the game.

## Message envelope

Most client -> server events take a plain payload. Events tied to an active game take an object with a `gameId` and, for a few of them, a nested `data`:

```ts
{ gameId: string, data: { ... } }
```

Server -> client game state updates arrive on a single event, `game:status`, shaped as:

```ts
{ name: Status, data: StatusDataMap[Status] }
```

where `name` is one of the status constants below and `data` is the payload for that specific status.

## Joining a game as a player

1. **Check the PIN** (optional, used by the web UI to validate before showing the join form). No authentication needed:

   ```
   POST /api/games/check   { "inviteCode": "..." }
   ->  { generatedUsernames: boolean }
   ```

   `generatedUsernames` tells you whether the host has the nickname generator on. If it is `true`, do not ask for a name — the server picks one. Errors: `404 errors:game.notFound` (unknown code), `403 errors:game.locked` (the host has closed the room: new players are refused until it is unlocked).

2. **Ask for a seat over HTTP**, with your session token as a bearer:

   ```
   POST /api/games/join   { "inviteCode": "...", "username": "..." }
   ->  { gameId, ticket, username }
   ```

   - `username` must be 1-24 characters ([validators/auth.ts](../packages/common/src/validators/auth.ts)). It is optional — and ignored — when the game generates nicknames, in which case the response `username` is `null` and you learn your name from `game:successJoin`.
   - The **ticket** is a short-lived (5 min) signed proof that you passed the invite code and that this username was accepted. It is bound to your `clientId`: another client cannot use it.
   - `ticket` comes back `null` when you already hold a seat in that game — skip step 3 and go straight to [Reconnecting](#reconnecting).
   - Errors: `404 errors:game.notFound` (unknown code), `403 errors:game.managerCannotJoin`, `403 errors:game.locked` (room locked by the host), `400` with a validation key, `401 errors:auth.unauthorized` (no bearer).

3. **Present the ticket on the socket.** This is what creates the seat and binds it to this connection:

   ```
   emit player:login { ticket }
   ```

   - `on game:successJoin { gameId, username, gameMode }`: you're in. `username` is your final name, which is the only way to learn it when the host generates nicknames. `gameMode` is `"quiz"` or `"survey"` — see [Survey mode](#survey-mode). The server also emits `manager:newPlayer` to the manager and `game:totalPlayers <count>` to everyone in the room.
   - `on game:reset <key: string>`: the ticket is expired, forged, or was minted for another client (`errors:auth.joinTicketInvalid` / `errors:auth.unauthorized`), the game is gone, the room was locked after the ticket was issued (`errors:game.locked`), or this `clientId` already has a player. Go back to step 1.

From here, wait for `game:status` events and react to the `name` field.

> The seat is created by step 3, not step 2: a ticket you never present leaves no trace on the server.

## Game status flow

The manager drives the game through a fixed sequence of statuses, broadcast to every player via `game:status`. A single button/buzzer client mainly cares about `SELECT_ANSWER` (when it should accept a button press) and, in quiz mode, `SHOW_RESULT` (whether that press was correct).

| Status          | Player payload (`data`)                                                                                                                         | What it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Survey mode

A quiz can be authored as a **survey** ([Quiz](quiz.md#survey-mode)): no scoring, no ranking, no correct answer. You learn the mode from `game:successJoin` and `player:successReconnect`, both of which carry `gameMode`.

For a client, three things change:

- **`SHOW_RESULT` never arrives.** When the question closes you get a `WAIT` with `data.text` set to `game:answerNoted` instead. A buzzer that lights up green or red on `SHOW_RESULT` simply never lights up.
- **The game ends on `SUMMARY`, not `FINISHED`.** Handle whichever your client cares about, but do not assume `FINISHED` is the only terminal status.
- **Points stay at zero.** There is no leaderboard, and a player's total never moves.

Everything else — joining, `SELECT_ANSWER`, submitting answers, reconnecting — is identical, so a client that treats `SHOW_RESULT` and `FINISHED` as optional works in both modes without any mode-specific code.

Other useful events while a game is in progress:

- `on game:updateQuestion { current: number, total: number }`: question index changed.
- `on game:totalPlayers <count: number>`: number of players in the room changed.
- `on game:reset <key: string>`: the session is no longer valid (manager left before start, you were kicked, game expired, etc). Treat this as "go back to the join screen."

## Submitting an answer

Only valid while the current status is `SELECT_ANSWER`, and only the **first** submission per question counts, submitting again is silently ignored:

```
emit player:selectedAnswer { gameId, data: { answerKeys: number[] } }
```

- `answerKeys` are 0-based indices into the `answers` array received in `SELECT_ANSWER`. For a `"single"` question, send a one-element array, e.g. `[1]` for the second button. For `"multi"`, send every button pressed, e.g. `[0, 2]`.
- Points are time-weighted (faster correct answers score higher), computed server-side from `time` and when you answer relative to the start of the answer window.
- After submitting, expect `data: { text: "game:waitingForAnswers" }` on the `WAIT` status, then, once the question closes (time runs out or every player has answered), `SHOW_RESULT` in quiz mode or another `WAIT` in survey mode.

This is the one event a 4-button ESP32 buzzer needs to send: map each physical button to an answer index and emit this event on press, once, while in `SELECT_ANSWER`.

## Reconnecting

If the socket disconnects (`disconnect` event fires implicitly, no action needed client-side) and reconnects, refresh the token (`POST /api/auth/session` with the stored one — the `clientId` is preserved), reconnect with it, and call:

```
emit player:reconnect { gameId }
```

- `on player:successReconnect { gameId, gameMode, status, player: { username, points }, currentQuestion }`: you're back in, `status` is the current `game:status` payload so you can resume the UI where it left off, and `gameMode` saves you from having to persist it across reboots.
- `on game:reset <key: string>`: the game no longer exists or this player slot is already connected elsewhere, start over from [Joining a game](#joining-a-game-as-a-player).

You need to persist `gameId` and the session `token` across reconnects/reboots to use this (e.g. in the ESP32's NVS flash) — a fresh `gameId` is only handed out by `POST /api/games/join` when first joining.

## Leaving a game

An unexpected drop (Wi-Fi loss, reboot) is handled by the server as a temporary disconnect: no event needed, just reconnect later with the same token as above.

If the player intentionally quits (e.g. a physical "leave" button), emit this instead so the manager sees them go immediately rather than just "disconnected":

```
emit player:leave { gameId }
```

Before the game has started this removes you from the player list entirely; once started, it behaves the same as a disconnect (marked disconnected, seat kept for a potential reconnect).

The same rule applies to an unexpected drop: **before the game starts there is no seat to come back to**, so a reconnect fails with `game:reset errors:game.notFound` and you rejoin from step 1. Once the game is running, the seat is kept.

## Full example

A minimal buzzer runs this sequence once, then just reacts to `game:status` until it sees `SELECT_ANSWER`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Player (buzzer)
    participant S as Server

    P->>S: POST /api/auth/session (stored token or {})
    S-->>P: { token, clientId }
    P->>S: POST /api/games/join (inviteCode, username)
    S-->>P: { gameId, ticket, username }
    P->>S: connect (auth: token)
    P->>S: player:login (ticket)
    S-->>P: game:successJoin (gameId, username, gameMode)

    loop each question
        S-->>P: game:status (SHOW_START / SHOW_PREPARED / SHOW_QUESTION)
        S-->>P: game:status (SELECT_ANSWER)
        P->>S: player:selectedAnswer (gameId, answerKeys)
        S-->>P: game:status (WAIT)
        S-->>P: game:status (SHOW_RESULT, quiz mode only)
    end

    S-->>P: game:status (FINISHED in quiz mode, SUMMARY in survey mode)
```

If the socket drops mid-game (Wi-Fi loss, reboot) and comes back, refresh the persisted token and replay it with the persisted `gameId` instead of joining again:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Player (buzzer)
    participant S as Server

    Note over P,S: connection lost mid-game

    P->>S: POST /api/auth/session (stored token)
    P->>S: connect (auth: token)
    P->>S: player:reconnect (gameId)
    S-->>P: player:successReconnect (gameMode, status, player, currentQuestion)

    Note over P: resume reacting to game:status from "status" onward
```

`key`/`message` string values here are i18n translation keys used by the web UI (e.g. `errors:game.notFound`), not human-readable text — treat them as symbolic error codes and map the ones you care about.

## Manager events

Out of scope for a buzzer client, but worth knowing they are guarded: `manager:startGame`, `manager:advance`, `manager:kickPlayer` and `manager:setLock` are **refused unless your token's `clientId` is the one that created that game** through `POST /api/games` — the refusal is `game:errorMessage errors:auth.unauthorized`. Creating a game, quiz CRUD, game settings and results are HTTP-only; see [HTTP API](http-api.md).

`manager:advance { gameId }` is the single "move the game forward" action: it cuts the answer window short while a question is open, and otherwise steps to whatever comes next — the answer reveal, the leaderboard, the following question or the end screen. The manager client does not decide that order; the server holds it, which is how survey mode can skip the leaderboard without any client change.

While the host has auto-advance enabled, the server ticks `manager:autoAdvance { seconds, total } | null` to the manager only, so the UI can show the countdown. `null` means the countdown was cleared.

`manager:setLock { gameId, locked }` locks or unlocks the room, at any point of the game. While it is locked, `POST /api/games/join` and `player:login` refuse new players with `errors:game.locked`; players already seated keep reconnecting normally. The server confirms with `manager:lockUpdated <locked: boolean>` to the manager, and `manager:successReconnect` carries the current `locked` value.
